# Know Your Countries

- Created an iOS application that allows users to improve their general knowledge about countries around the globe.
- Developed a Country Details View that contains numerous practical information about a certain country as well as its map and neighboring countries.
- Used a third-party library called SDWebImage that asynchronously downloads images to optimize app performance.
- Implemented a feature that allows you to favorite/unfavorite a country using Realm Database.
- Created assets to support Dark Mode making the app look great in low-light environments.
- Gained experience with Realm Database, UIKit, Rest APIs, Cocoa Touch Framework, Cocoapods, MVC design pattern, and Dark Mode support.
